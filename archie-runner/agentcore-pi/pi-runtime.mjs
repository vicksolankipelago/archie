/**
 * The pi-ai catalog trails Bedrock. Verified 2026-08-10: `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` is a
 * LIVE Bedrock inference profile (`aws bedrock list-inference-profiles`) that neither our pinned
 * 0.61.1 nor the then-latest 0.73.1 carries — the newest global opus in either is 4-7. So a bump
 * would NOT have fixed it; the gap is upstream data, not our version.
 *
 * Rather than silently downgrade such a job to the agent's default model, synthesise the Model from
 * its nearest CATALOGUED sibling: same family and generation, one minor older. `Model` is a plain
 * data interface, so cloning the sibling keeps every field real (api, baseUrl, reasoning,
 * contextWindow, maxTokens) and changes only `id`/`name` — and `id` is what the Bedrock Converse
 * call uses, so the request goes to the model that was actually asked for.
 *
 * CAVEAT, stated rather than hidden: `cost` and `contextWindow` are INHERITED from the sibling, so
 * cost telemetry (TurnCostUsd) for a synthesised model is approximate until the catalog catches up.
 * That is a reporting inaccuracy on ~7 prod jobs, traded against running them on the wrong model
 * entirely. The synthesised model is logged every time so it is never a silent substitution.

// ── Bedrock Claude model factory (the catalog's last resort) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. pi-ai's catalog is a compiled-in snapshot and Bedrock moves faster than it. As of
// 0.61.1 (and 0.70.2, the version OpenClaw itself bundles — so a bump does NOT fix this) the catalog
// carries no `claude-*-5` at all and no opus above 4-6, while this account can invoke sonnet-5,
// opus-5 and opus-4-8 today. `synthesiseFromSibling` covers ids of the form `<family>-<major>-<minor>`
// by cloning a catalogued relative; it cannot help `…-opus-5` (no minor to match) or `…-fable-5`
// (no `fable` family in the catalog at all).
//
// Before this, such an id threw. That mattered more than it sounds: pi-adapter's loadConfig is now
// fatal, so an unresolvable model is a crash-looping agent rather than a degraded one.
//
// WHAT IT CAN HONESTLY SYNTHESISE. Almost everything in a Model is constant or derivable for Bedrock
// Claude: `api`, `provider` and `input` are the same for every one, `baseUrl` follows the region.
// Only three values are genuinely per-model — contextWindow, maxTokens and cost — and those come
// from the table below.
//
// COST IS THE CAREFUL ONE. pi-ai computes each turn's USD from `model.cost`, and the adapter passes
// that through verbatim, deliberately emitting NOTHING when pi-ai reports no cost, because "a
// made-up cost that looks real is worse than a missing datapoint" (pi-adapter resolveTurnCostUsd).
// So a guessed price here would not be a small inaccuracy — it would defeat that rule fleet-wide.
// The table is therefore transcribed from AWS's OWN published prices, and a family that is not in it
// gets NaN cost fields: Pi requires the object for usage calculation, while the adapter
// omits non-finite cost metrics rather than reporting a fabricated price.

 * Thinking is ON for every Claude here, including Claude 5 — but only because the image patches

 *   "thinking.type.enabled" is not supported for this model.
 *   Use "thinking.type.adaptive" and "output_config.effort" to control thinking behavior.
 *
 * pi-ai 0.61.1 implements adaptive thinking correctly, but decides WHEN to use it from a hard-coded
 * substring list (`supportsAdaptiveThinking`, providers/amazon-bedrock.js) holding only opus-4-6 and
 * sonnet-4-6. Everything else got the legacy `thinking.type: "enabled"` block, which Claude 4 accepts
 * and Claude 5 rejects outright.
 *
 * THE FIRST FIX WAS TO DECLARE CLAUDE 5 NON-REASONING, which worked and cost extended thinking
 * fleet-wide. agentcore-pi/patch-pi-ai-adaptive-thinking.mjs replaces that: it widens the predicate
 * at image build time so Claude 5 takes the adaptive branch and thinking stays ON.
 *
 * SO `reasoning: true` HERE DEPENDS ON THAT PATCH. They cannot drift — the patch runs in the same
 * Dockerfile that builds this file into the image and FAILS THE BUILD if it cannot apply, so an
 * image containing this line always contains a pi-ai that honours it.
